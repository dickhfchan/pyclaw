The Process
Use OpenClaw as your blueprint, not your dependency
Clone the Openclaw repository (MIT licensed, 100% open source)
Point your coding agent at it - "Explain how the memory system works"
"Now build that into my own system here (optional: with customization XYZ)"
Repeat for heartbeat,
adapters, skills. That's it.

Read the OpenClaw repo. How does it implement the memory system? Now build me one using SQLite + Markdown. Keep it simple.
